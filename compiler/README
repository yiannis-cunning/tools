- There are five parts to assembly instruction
    1) PREFIX 
        - 0 to 4? bytes
        - can tell about op-sizes in displacement/immediate
        - can override operand sizes
        - can decalred other things about instructions you can tack on -> atomic, repeat...
    2) Opcode
        - 1 to 3 bytes
        - tells if Modrsm is there
        - tells if SIB is there
        - tells if Immediate is there
    3) Modrsm
        - 0 to 1 bytes
    4) SIB
        - 0 to 1 bytes
    5) Displacement
        - 0 to 4 bytes
    6) Immediate
        - 0 to 4 bytes
